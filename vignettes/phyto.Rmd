# Introduction
These functions have been created to aid in visualising phytoplankton counts in 
the Canning and Swan estuaries. There is a two stage process with details below.

# Stage One - Create summary data
Phytoplankton count data in its raw form (hereafter called raw data) provides 
count and other information for a multitude of species. In order to visualise 
the data it benefits from some summarising into larger groupings. This first 
stage undertakes this process and outputs summaries that are used in stage two.

After loading the `rivRmon` package, two file paths are provided to the 
`phyto_groupR()` function. A file path to the raw data xlsx spreadsheets and a 
file path to the desired location of the exported summary data. This summary 
data will be written to a `summaries/` directory and if it doesn't already exist 
it will be created.
```{r eval=FALSE}
#load the package
library(rivRmon)

#run the phyto_groupR function
phyto_groupR(pathin = "C:/path/to/raw_data", pathout = "C:/path/for_export")
```

The only thing to be careful of is ensuring that if you are copying a fiile path 
from a Windows OS you will need to double all the backslashes for the path to be 
recognised. The above example is the alternative method where the backslashes 
are converted to a single forward slash. An example of an exported summary csv 
is below.

# Stage Two - Creating the barcharts and running sheet
This next stage reads in all the summary data csv's and based on date provided, 
generates two barcharts, arranged vertically, in the one output. The top 
barchart is for the date provided and the bottom barchart is for the week prior. 
As sampling of the estuaries occurs on different days, the choice of date will 
only plot data for a single estuary. In other words it won't get confused when 
summary csv's exist for both estuaries.

The input for the `phyto_plotR()` function is a file path to the location of the 
`summaries/` directory not the summary csv's themselves. This is essentially the 
**pathout** parameter that you specified when running `phyto_groupR()`. The 
barcharts (as pdf) will be exported here along with a "running datasheet".

The running datasheet is a csv that is exported with all the summary data up to 
and including the date provided for that estuary. To run the function.
```{r eval=FALSE}
#run the phyto_plotR function
phyto_plotR(summary = "C:/path/for_export", date = "20190715")
```

Only two things to watch out for here. Again ensure that you have handled the 
character filepath correctly. Also provide the date as a character string in the 
format "yyyymmdd". It can be presented as above in the code snippet or contain 
separators (e.g. "2019/07/15" or "2019-07-15").

An example of a barchart follows. This one is for the Swan estuary (identified 
by its name and the sites present). The date provided is that in the code 
snippet above and is used in creating the top barchart. The function finds the 
summary data for the week prior and uses that to plot the bottom barchart.
